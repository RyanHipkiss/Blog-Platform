[24th May 2017 - 06:35:43] A new entity was found through the relationship 'App\Entity\Role#users' that was not configured to cascade persist operations for entity: App\Entity\User@000000005dd9f1f400007f5f75a03621. To solve this issue: Either explicitly call EntityManager#persist() on this unknown entity or configure cascade persist  this association in the mapping for example @ManyToOne(..,cascade={"persist"}). If you cannot find out which entity causes the problem implement 'App\Entity\User#__toString()' to get a clue.
